# Light Switch Extension Lever
The Light Switch Extension Lever is a lever designed to extend the toggle on a light switch. For some users with arthritis, limited grip strength or finger dexterity, it can be difficult to use a light switch. The Light Switch Extension Lever allows the user to flip the switch without needing any grip strength or nearly as much precision.
